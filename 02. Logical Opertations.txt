2. Logical Opertations

#Logical OR operation
a = 8
b = 3

if(a>0 or b<0):
    print("a is a positive number")
if(a<0 or b>0):
    print("b is a positive number")
if(a>0 or b>0):
    print("a and b are positive numbers")
if(a<0 or b<0):
    print("a and b are negative number")

#logical AND Operation
a = 8
b = 3

if(a>0 and b<0):
    print("a is a positive number")
if(a<0 and b>0):
    print("b is a positive number")
if(a>0 and b>0):
    print("a and b are positive numbers")
if(a<0 and b<0):
    print("a and b are negative number")

#checking for equality
a = 8
b = 3
c = 3

if a==b:
    print("a and b are equal")
else:
    print("a and b are not equal")
if b==c:
    print("b and c are equal")
else:
    print("b and c are not equal")

#Logical NOT Operation
a = 8

if not a:
    print("Boolean value of a is false")
if not(a%2==0 or a%3==0):
    print("a is not divisible by either a or b")
else:
    print("a is divisible by 2 and 3")

#Logical XOR Operation

a = 8
b = 4

xor = a^b
print("XOR of a=8 and b=4 is: ", xor)
